            Archie is a sharp, creative, lighthearted, fun individual who likes to work hard, smart and all with a geeky
            personality. He puts in efforts and thought to give back to his community while
            pushing himself academically and all while participating in extracurricular
            activities at school. He pursues his passions (technology & community
            give-back) extensively by going above and beyond the call of duty, an example
            of the same is, completing two computer science pathways instead of one. He
            does this through a signature program called AIOT (Academy of Information
            Technology) that teaches students practical computer science/IT skills. He
            pursues his passion in any available personal time by learning programming
            languages (e.g. Python), Azure, and mobile app development to expand his scope
            of knowledge. Additionally, Archie was so good in programming skills that he
            got recommended by his teacher to a higher-level class. His extracurricular
            activities are aligned to his passion for technology too. To that end he helped
            establish a TSA (Technology Student Association) club and is an active member
            & parliamentarian of this club. He won in the top 3 at the state level in TSA
            competitions such as robotics, geo-spatial technology, and videogame
            development. He was also a national level participant in Cybersecurity. More
            importantly he is always eager to learn, he goes to his programming teacher frequently
            during lunch to work on projects and to ask additional clarification questions
            to satisfy his curiosity. More impressively, he also has an industry
            certification, CompTIA A+ (1001, 1002), which proves his ability to be
            successful in the industry and gives him an edge over his peers. Furthermore, he
            gives back to his community whether at school or across the nation. For
            example, he gave back over four times the required community service hours. He
            has volunteered at the Board of Elections and received an ‘Global Citizenship’ award
            of recognition because of his efforts & contributions to assist the voters
            and election commission staff for the successful conclusion of the early voting
            during the primaries. At such an early age, he has secured an internship which
            shows his proactiveness in learning and using his skills. This isn’t just any
            internship but supports his ethos of community give back. He empowers the labor
            unions nation-wide by assisting in the development of a cloud-based union
            membership management platform for them. Lastly, he has held many leadership positions
            in his school including Patriot Ambassador and being a club officer in TSA and
            has made numerous positive contributions to his school; for example, he was a
            graduation speaker for AOIT’s graduation and volunteered over the summer to
            help run the main-office. Last but not least he is in the Student Ambassadors and SGA,
            this shows his eagerness to lead, to make a difference wherever he can, and to
            be a positive influence on others. He is also the President Elect of the TSA
            club. This is an example of being a leader not a follower in order to make
            positive contributions and differences in his close community by being a role
            model to others. He is a good team player & a leader who likes to
            get everyone involved.
